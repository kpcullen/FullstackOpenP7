## Full Stack Open - Part 7: React State Management, Hooks, and Routing: A Collection of Apps

This repository contains a series of frontend applications demonstrating different techniques for state management, hooks, and routing in React.

**Applications:**

- **BlogApp:** This app utilizes React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- **CountryApp:** This app showcases custom hooks for encapsulating reusable logic and state management.
- **AnecdotesApp:** This app demonstrates the use of React Router for managing navigation and routing within the application.

**Key Concepts:**

- **State Management:** Managing the data and state of a React application.
- **Hooks:** Reusable functions that let you access React features and state without writing a class component.
- **Routing:** Managing navigation and URL changes within a single-page application.

**Technologies:**

- React
- React Query
- Custom Hooks
- React Router

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-apps.git`
2. Navigate to the specific app directory you want to explore: `cd BlogApp`, `cd CountryApp`, or `cd AnecdotesApp`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm start`

**Explore the code:** Each app directory contains its own `src` folder with components, hooks, and other relevant files. Examine the code to understand how the specific state management, hook, or routing techniques are implemented.
